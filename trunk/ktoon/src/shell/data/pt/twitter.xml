<meaning>
A phoenix is a mythical bird that is a fire spirit with a colorful 
plumage and a tail of gold and scarlet (or purple, blue, and green 
according to some legends). It has a 500 to 1000 year life-cycle, 
near the end of which it builds itself a nest of twigs that then 
ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, 
from which a new, young phoenix or phoenix egg arises, reborn anew 
to live again.
