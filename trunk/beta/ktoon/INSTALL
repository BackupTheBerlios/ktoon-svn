Installing and Running KToon 2D Animation Toolkit

Before you begin, you need Qt version 3.3.2 or later to be installed.

First, download the source tarball from http://ktoon.toonka.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads.

Unpack it into your desired location and go into the uncompressed directory:
  $ tar xvfz ktoon-0.7.2.tgz
  $ cd ktoon/

Running the build script
  $ ./build.sh

And finally, run the application from the current directory:
  $ ./bin/ktoon

If you want to save disk space, remove the object files:
  $ make clean
