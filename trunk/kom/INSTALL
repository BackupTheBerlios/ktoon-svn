Note: Just for now, the KTooN project is only available for Unix systems. 
We hope to port it to many other platforms in the future. Meanwhile, the 
best way to try it is from any GNU/Linux distro (and FreeBSD or Unix-alike 
systems).

1. Dependencies

The compilation process of any software project requires a set of special 
tools previously installed in your system. Usually, they are called 
"dependencies".

In this case, before you start to compile KTooN, you have to ensure you 
already got the next list of dependencies installed in your computer:

    * build-essential: All the C/C++ free compilers, libraries and utilities
      required to create a binary from any Unix-alike C/C++ source code (gcc,
      g++, cpp, make, etc)
    * Qt 4.6.2: The full development toolkit used to create KTooN. Remember 
      to use the version 4.6.2, including development tools and libraries 
      (preview versions don't work at all).
    * ruby: A script language used to do the configuration process previous 
      to the compilation
    * libaspell-dev: A library to support spell revisions
    * libavcodec-dev: A subcomponent of the project ffmpeg, to deal with 
      video manipulation
    * libavformat-dev: A subcomponent of the project ffmpeg, to deal with 
      video manipulation
    * zlib-dev: A file-compression library

For Ubuntu users (version 10.04) with some experience using the console, 
these are the commands they should run to install KTooN dependencies:

- Open a terminal (from Aplications -> Accesories) and type:
   % sudo apt-get install build-essential    [Press enter]
   % sudo apt-get install ruby    [Press enter]
   % sudo apt-get install libaspell-dev    [Press enter]
   % sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev    [Press enter]
   % sudo apt-get install libqt4-gui qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools    [Press enter]
   % sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev    [Press enter]

Note: If you are not using Ubuntu, check for the equivalent packages for your
Linux distro

2. Get the source and compile

- Firstly, get KOM, the KTooN GUI framework from our Download section
  (http://www.ktoon.net/portal/download_counter). Then, run these commands:
   % tar xvfz kom-0.9a-revXXXX.tar.gz    [Press enter]
   % cd kom-0.9a-revXXX    [Press enter]
   % ./configure --prefix=/usr    [Press enter]
   % make    [Press enter]
   % sudo make install    [Press enter]

- Secondly, get the KTooN core application from our Download section
  (http://www.ktoon.net/portal/download_counter). Then, 
  run these commands:
   % tar xvfz ktoon-0.9a-revXXXX.tar.gz    [Press enter]
   % cd ktoon-0.9a-revXXX    [Press enter]
   % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ktoon    [Press enter]
   % make    [Press enter]
   % sudo make install    [Press enter]

Note: Only for advanced users, the configure script provides many options 
useful to set specific installation paths. Try "./configure --help" to get 
more information about it.

3. Animation time!

- Execute:
   % /usr/local/ktoon/bin/ktoon &    [Press enter]

Or look for the launcher from Applications -> Graphics -> KTooN

And enjoy KTooN!

installation notes with us, feel free to send us your documents.
