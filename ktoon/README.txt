This is KToon 2D Animation Toolkit Version 0.7.0.1

KToon is a 2D Animation Toolkit designed by animators (Toonka Films) for animators, focused to the Cartoon's industry. This project is covered by the GPL License using g++ and Qt as programming resources featuring KDevelop as the development platform.

Some of KToon 2D Animation Toolkit's features include:
- An easy way to split your project into illustration stage and animation stage, each one of them done by a separated module.
- Support of standard drawing tools for creating illustrations. These tools include the brush, the pencil, the line, the selection arrow, among other useful tools, presented within a set of categories. Also, it is possible to edit the properties of any object created by means of these tools.
- An scene manager. In KToon, you are able to modularize your animation project as a set of scenes.
- An Exposure Sheet dialog box, that permits to handle your illustrations by the layer approach, creating for each one of them a list of keyframes, where you may work as proposed by the principles of traditional animation.
- A Color Palette dialog box, in which you may obtain colors by means of several ways and moreover, create your own custom colors.
- A mechanism for editing your brushes properties such as minimum and maximum thickness and smoothness.
- Support of a graphic component library (similar to Macromedia Flash's (TM) graphic library), where it is possible to arrange hierarchically the most common used graphics in order to use them as many times as you need.
- A Time Line in which you may interact with the layers and frames in a chronological way.
- A set of dialog boxes that act as chameras, where you may preview your animation and modify the elements location within the space.
- A persistence scheme that allows to save a document and retrieve that document's information at any time.
- The possibility to export your work to standard formats, such as a sequence of PNG images or Macromedia Flash's SWF (TM).
- The capability to import images and image sequences from outside; brushes, custom color palettes and graphic libraries from previously created projects; and sounds in order to preview your animation's sound and music while adjusting the animation's frames to it.
