Ch is a complete C interpreter and C virtual
machine.  It runs on Windows/Linux/Solaris/HP-UX/OSX/FreeBSD.  The software
can be downloaded for free and more information can be found at
http://www.softintegration.com.  One of the great features of Ch is its
ability to run code without compilation.  In creating this binding to Ming,
we would then be able to run your code without compiling.
